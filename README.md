## üìã Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. The goal is to help banks identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive steps to retain them. By analyzing customer data, we can build a model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on various features like demographics, account details, and behavior patterns.

## üß† Model Architecture

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was built using the **TensorFlow Keras API**:

- **Input Layer**: 11 features
- **Hidden Layers**: 
  - **1st Hidden Layer**: 64 neurons, ReLU activation
  - **2nd Hidden Layer**: 32 neurons, ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation for binary classification

### **Training & Optimization**
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

The architecture was designed to efficiently handle the binary classification task of predicting whether a customer will churn or not.

## üìà Results

The model's performance was evaluated using multiple metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **Precision**: 82%
- **Recall**: 78%
- **F1 Score**: 80%

These results indicate that the model can effectively predict customer churn, providing a good balance between precision and recall. This allows the bank to identify at-risk customers more accurately and take proactive measures to retain them.

## üìù Insights & Future Work

### üîç Key Insights
- Customers with **low credit scores** and **higher account balances** are more likely to churn.
- Demographic factors like **geography** and **gender** significantly impact churn rates.
- Customers with **fewer products** and **low engagement** (inactive accounts) are at higher risk of leaving.

### üöÄ Future Enhancements
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Django for real-time predictions.
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrate additional customer data such as transaction history and customer service interactions to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Improvement**: Experiment with ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to boost performance.
- **Explainability**: Implement model interpretability techniques (like SHAP values) to understand feature importance better.
